# ChargeIQ — Smart Battery Optimization for Home Assistant

**Install it, forget it, and slash your energy bills.** ChargeIQ continuously optimizes your battery against live electricity prices, solar forecasts, and your household patterns.

### Setup in Minutes, Not Hours

No YAML files. No manual entering of entity IDs. The setup wizard auto-discovers your inverter, price source, and solar forecast from Home Assistant — just confirm and go.

### See Exactly Where Your Money Goes

ChargeIQ tracks every kWh and every cent. Compare three scenarios side by side — what you'd pay with **grid only**, with **solar only**, and with **solar + optimized battery** — so you can see exactly how much value the battery adds.

### Predictions You Can Trust

See how accurate the forecasts are — solar, consumption, and savings — with predicted-vs-actual comparisons so you know it's working, not guessing.

### Ask Your Battery Why

Something look off? The built-in AI Analyst explains every decision in plain language. Ask "why did the battery charge at 3am?" or "why are today's savings lower than yesterday?" and get a real answer backed by actual system data.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Optimization** | Dynamic programming finds the mathematically optimal schedule — not a simulation, not a heuristic |
| **Resolution** | 15-minute granularity (Nordpool) or 30-minute (Octopus) |
| **Solar aware** | Integrates solar forecast to maximize self-consumption |
| **Battery protection** | Models cycle degradation cost — won't chase marginal gains that wear out your battery |
| **Fuse protection** | Plans schedules and monitors real-time grid current to keep charging within your main fuse's limit |
| **Peak shaving** | Cap grid import during a configured time window, independent of price — for capacity/demand tariffs that charge by your peak import power |
| **EV aware** | Automatically pauses battery discharge when your EV is charging |
| **Planned loads** | Declare upcoming EV charging or other known consumption changes so forecasts — and the dashboard — account for them, then check what happened against the plan |
| **Re-optimization** | Continuously updates as prices, solar, and consumption data change |
| **AI Analyst** | Chat with your battery system — ask questions, get explanations |
