"""The execution model: what a command means on the platform that executes it.

Phase 4a of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-optimizer-target-architecture.md`
(design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-phase4-executable-candidates-design.md`,
decisions D1 and D2).

This module is a **leaf**: it imports `settings` and `dp_constants` and
nothing else in `core.bess`. That constraint is the whole point of D1, not a
style preference. `simulation/inverter_simulator` needs the intra-period
discharge gate and so did `battery_system_manager`, which is why the gate used
to live in the orchestrator; the optimizer core (`action_selector`,
`dp_battery_algorithm`, `pwl_window_dp`) needs the same platform facts to know
which actions are executable. With the gate here, both sides depend on a leaf
instead of the optimizer depending on the thing that runs the optimizer.
`dp_battery_algorithm:_run_dynamic_programming` already works around one
import cycle with a function-local import; per `rules.md`'s workaround check,
adding a second was not an option.

What lives here is the platform half of the execution model -- the lattice a
discharge rate is quantized to, what a discharge *number* means once written,
the mode vocabulary, and the smallest gear that can be commanded. Turning a
planned action into a full command (mode + rate + reactive semantics) is 4b's
work and lands here too; 4a deliberately moves no candidate logic.

    for a planned power of `power_kw` -- **rounded in the direction the
    written number's own semantics require** (Phase 4b for discharge, 4c for
    charge; `step_kw` is the caller's lattice, so the same function serves
    both).

    This is the one place the planned-power -> written-command conversion
    happens. Both ends of it used to round to nearest and neither knew what
    the number meant once written:

    - Where the rate is a **ceiling** (`load_first` on TOU-register
      hardware), firmware delivers `min(number, actual load)`. Rounding to
      nearest rounds *down* half the time, and a ceiling below the plan
      under-delivers it -- measured over the corpus, 539 of 1377 house
      deficits round down. So a ceiling must be at least the plan, and
      `ceil` is the **smallest** lattice value that is: not a free choice,
      the tightest admissible one.

      A **charge** rate takes this branch too (4c), but for a different
      reason: what binds above the command there is the battery's own
      remaining room -- the inverter stops when full -- not house load. The
      distinction matters because it fails where an import cap is what
      limited the plan, and `lattice_grid_charge` handles that case by
      bringing the plan down instead.

      This is what makes exact cover exact, and
      the property the whole exact-cover candidate rests on
      (`action_selector._residual_cover_p`).

      **It is not free, and the cost is real if small.** A ceiling above the
      plan is headroom the battery will use if actual load exceeds the
      forecast -- including in periods where the #520 intra-period gate is
      deliberately CLOSED, i.e. where the DP decided the stored energy is
      worth more than buying now and specifically does not want that
      coverage. Measured on this branch's goldens: 436 of 756 LOAD_SUPPORT
      periods get a ceiling strictly above plan, 31 of them with the gate
      closed, each by at most one lattice step.

      There is no rounding that both delivers the plan and never exceeds it
      -- the lattice is coarser than the deficit, which is the whole reason
      this phase exists -- so the choice is between a *certain*
      under-delivery and a *possible* over-delivery bounded by one step.
      Nearest-rounding did not avoid this; it leaked up to half a step in
      the same periods while also under-delivering in the other half. Do not
      "fix" it by making the direction depend on the gate: that is a second
      construction site for the same conversion, and the drift between two
      such sites is #282's failure shape.
    - Where the rate is a **target** (`grid_first` anywhere, `load_first` on
      native SolaX), the number *is* the delivered power. Nearest is correct
      there and rounding up would discharge and export more than planned --
      so the direction is a function of the command, not a global setting.
      The `LATTICE_EPS` nudge applies to the ceiling branch only: `round`
      is half-to-even in Python, so a plan landing exactly halfway between
      two steps resolves to the even one. That is arbitrary but symmetric,
      and biasing it would be a silent half-step change on every target
      platform.

    Keeping both directions in one function is the point: this conversion
    drifting from what the planner assumed is #282's and #497's shared shape,
    and before this it was written out five times (the controller's discharge
    and charge paths, the simulator's mirror of both, and the planner's own
    executability gate).

    command lattice (Phase 4c, narrow fix).

    Only a grid-charging period needs this. `INTENT_TO_CONTROL` writes a flat
    `charge_rate: 100` for SOLAR_STORAGE and IDLE, so their plan is never
    scaled and never rounds; GRID_CHARGING is the one intent whose rate is
    derived from the plan itself (`compute_charge_rate`, which rounded to
    nearest until 4c). A planned power between two steps was
    therefore written as the step *below* and the inverter charges less than
    the plan assumed -- measured pre-fix as 4 of 493 charging periods, worst
    -0.0288 kWh.

    The reduction lands on the grid component, never on solar: the total is
    what gets scaled (`battery_action` is `solar_to_battery +
    grid_to_battery`), but solar is free and already in the battery's reach,
    so giving up grid energy is the cheap side. Quantizing solar as well
    would floor 311 further periods and discard 3.70 kWh of storable solar
    across the corpus for no fidelity gain, since those periods are commanded
    at 100% anyway.

    **Down, never up** -- the asymmetry with the discharge side is physical,
    not stylistic. A discharge ceiling can be rounded up because actual house
    load binds below it (Phase 4b). Nothing binds a *charge* command from
    above: where `import_cap_kwh` is what limited the plan (#429), rounding
    up would draw more from the grid than the house fuse allows. So the plan
    comes down to the lattice instead of the command going up to the plan.

    Accepts scalars or arrays; returns the matching shape. Where no grid
    top-up is planned the value passes through untouched.

    The step is `max_charge_power_kw / 100`, matching what the controller
    scales against. A declared per-platform charge resolution (the charge-side twin
    of `discharge_resolution_kw`) does not exist yet -- that belongs with the
