"""Growatt VPP execution model, so VPP behaviour changes are measurable.

`inverter_simulator.py` is Growatt MIN/cloud **TOU** only. Every scenario
fixture, every `run_scenario_realized` call and the whole R == P corpus
therefore covers the TOU path and says nothing about VPP -- which is why
"no regression from beta" was unenforceable for Growatt VPP (#539).

**Read a delta from this as "behaviour changed", never as "behaviour got
worse".** At 15-minute point forecasts there is no within-period load spike
by construction, so this can model the intra-period discharge gate's *cost*
(battery held -> import at buy price) but never its *benefit* (spike covered
from the battery). It will therefore score gate-closed changes as a loss
whether or not they are one. That is not speculative: mirroring the gate for
LOAD_SUPPORT in the TOU simulator moves 27 of 36 fixtures by +25.67 SEK of
realized cost, "purely from the unmodellable half of the trade-off"
(`inverter_simulator._map_rates`). Against a fixed baseline the bias cancels
and a delta means *changed*, which is the question this harness exists to
answer. Quoting a delta as an economic verdict is the misuse to guard
against -- several figures in this repo have already been retracted for
exactly that drift.

The command mapping is NOT re-implemented here. `_intent_to_vpp` on the real
`SolaxModbusGrowattController` is called directly, so the simulator cannot
drift from what production writes -- the P1/P4 lesson from Phases 1 and 3,
where hand-mirrored copies of the same logic were the whole bug class.

    to derive every command with `at_reserve_floor=False`, leaving the release
    branch unreachable through the whole 37-fixture corpus while the baseline
    looked like it covered it.

    Note this derives commands *eagerly*, so it is only correct where the
    trajectory is already known. `simulate_vpp` does not use it -- there the
    SoE is produced by the simulation itself, so each command is derived from
    the running SoE as the loop reaches it.

    Drives the production path end to end:
    `compute_rates_for_period` -> `_intent_to_vpp`, the same two calls
    `BatterySystemManager._apply_period_schedule` makes. Nothing about the
    intent -> (grid_charge, discharge_rate, block_passive_charging) mapping
    is restated here.

    An earlier revision rebuilt those three values from `INTENT_TO_CONTROL`
    by hand. It happened to agree on every intent, but it was a second copy
    of a mapping that production owns -- the drift this harness exists to
    catch, reintroduced inside the harness itself -- and it carried a
    `.get(intent, IDLE)` fallback where `_map_intent_to_rates` raises on an
    unknown intent, so a typo would have silently simulated IDLE.

    Deliberately does not pass the intra-period discharge decision, so it
    always derives the pre-#520 command for a period (`load_tracking_active`
    defaults False on `_intent_to_vpp`). It is the gate-free baseline the
    #539/#540 pins are captured from. The load-tracking path (#520) needs the
    running SoE and the period length to bound a budget, so it lives only in
    `simulate_vpp`, which carries both; there is no correct eager form of it.
