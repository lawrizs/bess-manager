"""Standing pins between the vectorized backward induction and the selector.

P1 (`docs/agents/optimizer-architecture.md`) lets the grid DP's backward
pass keep its own numpy evaluator for speed -- routing it through
`select_action` measured 256x slower (0.11 s -> ~29 s per solve on
`regression_2026_08_08_143843`) and would additionally change behavior,
since that pass deliberately estimates V over a coarser power lattice than
the replay chooses actions on. The price of that exemption is this file: a
vectorized evaluator that drifts from the selector's is #236 reproduced,
and drift is silent -- V is never compared against anything downstream.

Two things are pinned here, matching the two ways the passes can diverge:

1. The evaluators must agree bit-for-bit on the physics
   (`_state_transition_grid`/`_compute_reward_grid` vs the scalar
   `_state_transition`/`_compute_reward` the selector evaluates candidates
   with).
2. The backward pass must value every *candidate type* the selector can
   choose. The lattice itself legitimately differs; a candidate the
   selector can pick but V has never heard of does not -- that is exactly
   how a plan ends up ranked by a value function that does not know the
   plan exists.
