"""Shared capture path for the Growatt VPP regression baseline (#539).

One definition of "run this fixture and record what VPP would do", used by
both `scripts/capture_vpp_baseline.py` (which writes the baseline) and
`test_vpp_regression_baseline.py` (which re-runs and compares) -- the same
arrangement, and for the same reason, as `golden_capture.py`.

**Why the baseline stores the plan, not just the cost.** The DP's plan and
the VPP execution model are separate things that can each move. Recording
`(strategic_intent, battery_action)` per period alongside the realized cost
means a failing pin says *which* changed: a plan difference points at the
optimizer, a cost-only difference points at the simulator or the command
mapping. A cost-only baseline would leave that to guesswork.

**This also makes the v10.0.2 baseline possible at all.** `vpp_simulator`
depends on `_period_flows`, which does not exist at v10.0.2 (it arrived with
Phase 3), so the tagged code cannot run today's simulator. Capturing the
plan at the tag and simulating it with today's model sidesteps that
entirely, and is the more useful split anyway: it holds the execution model
fixed so the comparison isolates planner changes.
