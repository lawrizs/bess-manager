# BESS Manager User Guide

Welcome to the BESS Manager! This guide will help you understand the interface, interpret optimization results, and get the most out of your battery storage system.

For a full explanation of *why* the optimizer decides what it decides — the economics, the reasoning model, and what the intent labels mean — see [ALGORITHM_EXPLAINED.md](ALGORITHM_EXPLAINED.md).

## Getting Started

Once installed and configured, access your BESS Manager dashboard through:

- **Home Assistant**: Add-ons → BESS Manager → Open Web UI
- **Direct URL**: `http://your-home-assistant:8080` (if configured for external access)

## Dashboard Overview

### Main Dashboard

The main dashboard provides a real-time overview of your energy system:

#### Re-optimize now

BESS rebuilds the schedule automatically every quarter hour. Saving a setting
applies it to the running system straight away but does not itself trigger a
replan, so a change to prices, grid fees, cycle cost or the power limits only
reaches the plan on the next scheduled run — up to 15 minutes later.

**Re-optimize now** closes that gap: it runs the same optimization the
scheduler does and waits for it to finish, so once the button returns the new
schedule is in force. If the optimization fails — missing prices, an
unreachable sensor — the error is shown and the previous schedule stays
active. The button is hidden when you are viewing a past day, since history
cannot be replanned.

#### System Status Card

- **Current SOC**: Battery charge percentage and energy (kWh)
- **Power Flows**: Real-time power in/out of battery, solar, and grid
- **System Health**: Green/Yellow/Red indicators for all components
- **Active Strategy**: Current optimization strategy (Grid Charging, Solar Storage, etc.)

#### Today's Energy Flows

- **Solar Production**: Total solar energy generated today
- **Home Consumption**: Energy consumed by your home
- **Battery Activity**: Energy charged/discharged
- **Grid Interaction**: Energy imported/exported
- **Savings**: Estimated cost savings vs. no optimization

### Understanding the Charts

#### 1. Energy Flow Chart

An hourly (or 15-minute) chart of your whole day, today and tomorrow. Energy sources stack above the zero line, consumption stacks below it, and price is plotted on its own axis on the right:

- **🌞 Solar Production**, **🔋 Battery Discharge**, **⚡ Grid Import** — where your energy came from, stacked together
- **🏠 Home Load**, **🔋 Battery Charge**, **⚡ Grid Export** — where it went, stacked below the zero line
- **Buy Price** (and, if enabled, **Sell Price**) — a dashed line against the right-hand axis

A shaded band marks the hours that have already elapsed today; a second shade marks tomorrow's forecast, once available.

**Home Load, split into Planned Load**

If you've declared a **Planned Consumption Change** (e.g. tonight's EV session — see "Planned Consumption Changes" below), the chart splits **Home Load** into two stacked pieces for the hours the plan covers:

- **Home Load** — your normal forecast for that hour, from whichever consumption strategy you've configured
- **Planned Load** — the extra (or reduced) energy the declaration adds on top

Together they still stack to the same total the optimizer planned against — the split is purely so you can see how much of an hour's forecast is "normal" versus "because of what I told it to expect."

**Forecast Total — checking a plan against what happened**

Once an hour with a declared plan has passed, the chart keeps showing what was actually measured (the solid Home Load area), but adds a dashed **Forecast Total** line marking what had been planned for that hour. A gap between the solid area and the dashed line means the plan didn't play out as declared — the EV charged less (or more) than announced, for instance. Hours with no plan attached never show this line; it's there to check a specific declaration, not to grade general forecast accuracy — the **Insights** page's Forecast Accuracy view is for that.

#### 2. Battery Level Chart

Shows battery charge level throughout the day with strategic context:

- **Purple periods**: Grid charging (storing cheap electricity)
- **Yellow periods**: Solar storage (storing free solar energy)
- **Blue periods**: Load support (using battery to power home)
- **Green periods**: Export arbitrage (selling stored energy for profit)
- **Gray periods**: Idle (no significant battery activity)

**Reading the strategy**:

- **GRID_CHARGING**: Buying cheap electricity to store
- **SOLAR_STORAGE**: Storing excess solar production
- **LOAD_SUPPORT**: Using battery to power your home
- **BATTERY_EXPORT**: Selling stored battery energy at high prices
- **SOLAR_EXPORT**: Solar surplus going directly to grid, battery idle

#### 3. Detailed Savings Analysis

Comprehensive breakdown of your savings:

- **Grid-Only Cost**: What you would pay without optimization
- **Optimized Cost**: Actual cost with BESS Manager
- **Total Savings**: Money saved (can be negative during investment periods)
- **ROI Tracking**: Progress toward return on investment

### Detailed System Status

The system status card provides key metrics and health information:

- **Battery SOC**: Current charge level (percentage and kWh)
- **Real-time Power**: Current power flows (solar, battery, grid, consumption)
- **System Health**: Component status indicators (sensors, integrations)
- **Today's Totals**: Energy flows and estimated savings for today
- **Strategic Intent**: Current optimization strategy being executed

## Understanding Optimization Strategies

### Strategic Intents Explained

#### 🔋 GRID_CHARGING

- **What**: Charging battery from grid during low-price periods
- **Why**: Store cheap energy to use/sell later
- **When**: Typically night hours with low electricity prices
- **Indicator**: Battery charging, grid import high

#### ☀️ SOLAR_STORAGE

- **What**: Charging battery with excess solar production
- **Why**: Store free solar energy for evening/night use

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### View Logs for Troubleshooting

When reporting issues or debugging problems, check the add-on logs for detailed information:

1. Go to **Home Assistant** → **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **BESS Manager**
2. Click on the **Log** tab
3. Review the logs for errors or warnings

The logs show:

- Sensor data collection and validation
- Optimization algorithm decisions and reasoning
- Schedule creation and inverter communication
- Price data fetching and processing
- Component health checks and errors

**Tip**: Use the **Refresh** button to see the latest log entries. For historical logs, you can use the Home Assistant system log viewer.

### "No optimization happening"

**Symptoms**: Battery stays at same level, no strategic intents
**Causes**:

- Price differences too small to justify battery wear
- Battery already at optimal level
- System in learning mode (first few days)

**Solutions**:

- Check electricity price integration is working (Nordpool or Octopus Energy)
- Verify price spread is significant enough to justify battery wear
- Wait for price volatility periods

### "Savings are negative"

**Symptoms**: Dashboard shows negative savings
**Causes**:

- System is investing in battery charge for future savings
- Battery wear costs temporarily exceed immediate benefits
- Learning period with suboptimal decisions

**Solutions**:

- Look at weekly/monthly totals instead of daily
- Check if system is building charge for upcoming peak prices
- Verify battery wear cost settings are reasonable

### "Energy flows don't balance"

**Symptoms**: Energy in ≠ energy out in charts
**Causes**:

- Sensor timing differences
- Recorder history gaps for the affected hours
- Battery efficiency losses

**Solutions**:

- Check all sensors are reporting correctly
- Verify Home Assistant's recorder is retaining these sensors (not excluded, `purge_keep_days` ≥ 2)
- Small imbalances (<5%) are normal due to efficiency losses

### "Battery not following schedule"

**Symptoms**: Battery behavior doesn't match predicted schedule
**Causes**:

- Home consumption higher/lower than predicted
- Solar production different than forecast
- Grid power limitations
- Inverter safety overrides

**Solutions**:

- Check if actual consumption matches predictions
- Verify solar forecast accuracy
- Review inverter settings and error logs
- System will auto-adapt within 1-2 hours

## Optimizing Your Settings

### Battery Settings

- **Total Capacity**: Match your actual battery capacity exactly
- **Min SOC**: Set safety margin (10-20% recommended)
- **Max Charge Power** / **Max Discharge Power**: The power ceilings the optimizer plans within, in kW. Set them separately when your inverter charges and discharges at different rates; use the same value for both otherwise. Derive from your battery's C-rate — e.g. 30 kWh × 0.5C = 15 kW.
- **Cycle Cost**: Balance between battery wear and optimization aggressiveness

### Electricity Price Settings

BESS needs hourly spot prices to decide when to charge and discharge. Four price providers are supported — pick the one that matches the integration you have installed in Home Assistant.

#### Provider: Nord Pool (official HA integration)

Recommended for most European users. This is the official Nord Pool integration built into Home Assistant (available since HA 2024.10).

- **Prerequisites**: Add Nord Pool under Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Nord Pool. Configure your market area (e.g. SE4, NO1, DK1, FI) and currency there.
- **How it works**: BESS calls the `nordpool.get_prices_for_date` service using the Config Entry ID to fetch today's and tomorrow's hourly spot prices.
- **Config Entry ID**: A unique identifier for your Nord Pool integration instance. Auto-detected by Auto-Configure. You can also find it in the HA URL when viewing the integration (the long hex string).
- **Area & Currency**: Determined by the integration's own configuration and shown read-only in BESS. These are not configurable in BESS — change them in the HA Nord Pool integration settings if needed.

#### Provider: Nord Pool (HACS custom sensor)

For users with the Nord Pool HACS custom integration (installed from [github.com/custom-components/nordpool](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool)).

- **Prerequisites**: Nord Pool installed via HACS. The integration creates a single sensor entity whose name encodes the area and currency, e.g. `sensor.nordpool_kwh_se4_sek_3`.
- **How it works**: BESS reads the `raw_today` and `raw_tomorrow` attributes from your Nord Pool sensor to get hourly spot prices. Both today's and tomorrow's prices live on the same sensor entity.
- **Sensor**: The entity ID of your Nord Pool sensor. Auto-detected by Auto-Configure, or enter it manually.
- **Area & Currency**: Inferred from the sensor name and shown read-only in BESS.

#### Provider: Octopus Energy

For UK users on the Octopus Energy Agile tariff.

- **Prerequisites**: The Octopus Energy HACS integration installed and configured. It creates event entities that update with upcoming half-hourly rates.
- **How it works**: BESS reads four event entities — today's and tomorrow's import rates, and today's and tomorrow's export rates. Prices are already VAT-inclusive in GBP/kWh.
- **Entities**: Four event entity IDs for import/export today/tomorrow. All are auto-detected by Auto-Configure.

#### Provider: ENTSO-e / Belpex (Transparency Platform)

For European users on a day-ahead dynamic tariff that follows the ENTSO-e Transparency Platform — including Belgian **Belpex** prices (Luminus dynamic and others).

- **Prerequisites**: The [ENTSO-e Transparency Platform](https://github.com/JaccoR/hass-entso-e) HACS integration installed and configured with your area (e.g. Belgium). It creates an "Average electricity price" sensor, e.g. `sensor.belpex_h_average_electricity_price`.
- **How it works**: BESS reads the `prices_today` and `prices_tomorrow` attributes from that single sensor. Each is a list of `{"time", "price"}` entries. Hourly data (PT60M, 24/day) is expanded to the internal 15-minute resolution; native quarterly data (PT15M, 96/day) is used as-is.
- **Sensor**: The entity ID of the ENTSO-e average-price sensor. Auto-detected by Auto-Configure, or enter it manually.
- **Prices & VAT**: ENTSO-e prices are wholesale spot prices in EUR/kWh and VAT-**exclusive** by default, so BESS applies the markup/VAT/fees below — just like Nord Pool. ⚠️ If you configured a custom VAT *modifyer* inside the ENTSO-e integration, its prices already include VAT; in that case set the BESS VAT Multiplier to 1.0 to avoid double-counting.

#### Price Calculation

Once BESS has the raw spot price from your provider, it applies your configured fees and taxes to compute the actual buy and sell prices used for optimization:

- **Markup Rate**: Your energy provider's margin fee, applied before VAT. E.g. Tibber charges ~0.08 SEK/kWh, Ellevio ~0.15.
- **VAT Multiplier**: The VAT factor. 1.25 = 25% (Sweden/Norway), 1.24 = 24% (Finland), 1.22 = 22% (Estonia), 1.20 = 20% (UK).
- **Additional Costs**: Grid transfer fee + energy tax, summed as a single per-kWh value including VAT. E.g. E.ON: (0.2584 + 0.3600) × 1.25 = 0.773 SEK/kWh.
- **Import Spot Multiplier** / **Export Spot Multiplier**: Contract-specific factors applied to the raw spot price, on the import and export sides respectively. Leave both at 1.0 unless your contract scales spot.
- **Export Compensation**: Per-kWh payment from your grid operator when you sell surplus electricity. Check your energy bill, e.g. E.ON under "Producent/Självfaktura": 0.1988 SEK/kWh.
- **Time-of-use grid fee** (optional): For operators that bill distribution by time of day rather than at one flat rate — e.g. ESO in Lithuania. Switch it on and enter a final, VAT-inclusive rate per period; it is added *on top of* Additional Costs, so keep whatever flat component you still pay there and set it to 0 if the whole grid fee is time-varying.

The formulas:

- **Buy price** = (spot × import multiplier + markup) × VAT multiplier + additional costs + time-of-use grid fee
- **Sell price** = spot × export multiplier + export compensation

#### Setting a fixed sell price

Some contracts pay a flat rate per exported kWh rather than anything derived
from spot — e.g. 0.0726 EUR/kWh in Lithuania. Express that by removing the spot
term from the sell side:

- **Export Spot Multiplier** = `0`
- **Export Compensation** = your flat rate (e.g. `0.0726`)

The sell price is then exactly that rate in every period, whatever spot does.
Import pricing is unaffected — the import multiplier is separate.

The distribution fee is billed on import only, so it never affects the sell price.

#### Time-of-use grid fee periods

Period boundaries are fixed and follow the published Lithuanian schedule, in your
Home Assistant local time:

| Period | Mon–Fri | Sat/Sun |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Morning | 05:00–07:00 | — |
| Day | 07:00–17:00 | 07:00–22:00 |
| Evening | 17:00–22:00 | — |
| Night | 22:00–05:00 | 22:00–07:00 |

Public holidays are billed on the weekend schedule by most operators. BESS does
not detect them, so on those days the morning and evening rates are still
applied — a small overestimate of cost on roughly a dozen days a year.

For Octopus Energy, prices are already final (VAT-inclusive, GBP/kWh). Markup, VAT, and Additional Costs are not applied — only Export Compensation is used.

### Consumption Prediction

BESS needs a forecast of your home consumption to plan the battery schedule. Four strategies are available, configured via `home.consumption_strategy` in your add-on settings:

#### Strategy 1: `sensor` (legacy)

This strategy is selectable only once the `48h_avg_grid_import` sensor is configured: it is the one strategy with no fallback, so choosing it without that sensor means no schedule can be built at all and the dashboard never leaves "Initializing". New installs default to `fixed`; `ha_statistics` is the recommended choice (see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md), Step 3).

BESS reads a Home Assistant sensor named `*48h_avg*grid_import*` (the exact entity ID is auto-discovered by name pattern). This sensor should be a 48-hour rolling average of your grid import power, filtered to exclude periods when the battery is active. See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md), Step 3 for how to create it.

The same flat value is used as the predicted consumption for all 96 periods of the day — it is an average, not a time-of-day profile.

**Why filter out battery activity?** When the battery discharges, it reduces grid import. Without the filter, battery-active periods would lower the average and cause the optimizer to under-predict consumption.

**EV charging — include or exclude?**

- **Exclude** (recommended for most users): The average reflects pure home consumption. The optimizer does not plan for EV charging load, but the discharge inhibit sensor (see below) prevents the battery from discharging while the car charges. This is the more robust choice when EV charging is irregular.
- **Include**: The optimizer sees the total actual load and may hold back battery capacity in anticipation. This works well only if you charge the car on a very predictable schedule (same time, same amount every night).

The 48h window is a sensible default. If your consumption varies strongly with season (e.g. heat pump), you can create the sensor with a shorter window (12–24h) so it adapts faster — just keep the `48h_avg_grid_import` naming so BESS discovers it correctly.

#### Strategy 2: `fixed`

Uses a single fixed kWh/hour value set in `home.default_hourly`. No sensor required. Useful as a fallback or for very predictable consumption, but does not adapt to actual usage.

#### Strategy 3: `load_power_7d_avg`

Reads the past 7 days of your local load power sensor from Home Assistant's recorder and builds a 96-period average profile (one value per 15-minute slot, averaged across the same slot for the last 7 days). This gives a time-of-day shaped forecast — higher during evening peaks, lower overnight — rather than a flat value.

Requires the `local_load_power` sensor configured in your add-on sensor settings. Unlike `ha_statistics` it does **not** need a `lifetime_load_consumption` entity, so it works on platforms (e.g. SolaX Native, Solis) that only derive that value. (Was named `influxdb_7d_avg` before it moved to the recorder; the old id is still accepted.)

#### Strategy 4: `ha_statistics`

Uses Home Assistant's built-in Recorder long-term statistics to build a 96-period time-of-day consumption profile from the past 7 days. Like `load_power_7d_avg`, this produces a shaped forecast — higher during evening peaks, lower overnight — but from the cumulative load-energy statistics rather than instantaneous power samples.

Requires the `lifetime_load_consumption` sensor configured in the **Sensors** tab (under Consumption Forecast). This should be a cumulative energy sensor (kWh) tracked by HA's long-term statistics — for example `sensor.load_energy_total` from your inverter integration.

**How it works**: BESS queries the HA Recorder for hourly `change` statistics over the past 7 days, groups them by hour-of-day, and computes a trimmed mean (dropping the highest and lowest values) for each hour. This filters out outlier spikes like occasional EV charging sessions while preserving the true daily consumption shape. The hourly averages are then split into 15-minute periods.

**Safeguards**:

- The option is **greyed out** in Settings if the required sensor is not configured.
- If the sensor is configured but HA has not yet accumulated enough history (fewer than 12 hours of data), BESS automatically **falls back to the fixed profile** and shows a warning on the dashboard. Once HA accumulates sufficient data (typically within 12-24 hours of first configuring the sensor), the system self-heals and the warning auto-dismisses.

This is the recommended strategy for most users — it adapts to your actual usage patterns with no extra integrations or configuration beyond a cumulative load sensor.

#### Managed Loads — excluding a regular habit from the baseline

The trimmed mean above filters out an occasional spike, but not a *regular* one — if you charge your EV most nights, `ha_statistics` learns that as part of your normal pattern and forecasts it every night, whether or not you're actually charging. **Managed Loads** is how you tell BESS to exclude a load entirely and announce it yourself instead.

In the **Home** settings tab, under `ha_statistics`, add the load's own cumulative/lifetime energy sensor (e.g. `sensor.ev_charger_energy_total` — most EV chargers expose one; tools like evcc can synthesize one for chargers that don't) to **Managed load sensors**. BESS subtracts that sensor's energy from the historical data before computing the baseline, so the learned "normal" becomes the residual — your house load with the managed load excluded.

With the load excluded, it simply isn't forecast at all unless you say otherwise — the recommended setup is to exclude it here, then announce expected sessions via **Planned Consumption Changes** below (e.g. "EV needs 8 kWh by 06:30"). This is the same residual-plus-announcement pattern EMHASS uses for controllable loads.

Only `ha_statistics` supports this today — `load_power_7d_avg` draws from a different data source and would need its own mechanism.

#### Comparing Strategies

The **Insights** page includes a **Consumption Forecast Comparison** section that evaluates all available strategies against your actual consumption. Each strategy shows its hourly profile overlaid on actual data, along with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. Use this to verify which strategy best matches your real consumption patterns before committing to one.

#### Planned Consumption Changes — telling BESS what's coming

Every strategy above describes your *normal* usage. None of them can know the EV is charging tonight, that you're skipping the pool pump, or that a heatwave will have the AC running all afternoon. **Planned Consumption Changes** is how you say so.

It is not a fifth strategy — it applies on top of whichever one you use. If you never configure it, nothing changes.

Create a template sensor whose `blocks` attribute lists what differs, then point BESS at it in the **Sensors** tab under **Planned Consumption Changes**.

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "BESS Planned Consumption Changes"
        # `state` is cosmetic -- BESS reads the `blocks` attribute below
        # regardless of it, precisely so a helper this depends on going
        # temporarily "unknown" can't block your schedule. Anything
        # human-readable works; a fixed literal is simplest.
        state: "ok"
        attributes:
          blocks: >
            {% set blocks = [] %}
            {# The EV charges overnight: 40 kWh between 22:00 and 06:00.
               Anchor to YESTERDAY's 22:00 in the small hours, otherwise
               today_at('22:00') rolls forward at midnight and the running
               session vanishes from the forecast exactly when it matters. #}
            {% if is_state('input_boolean.ev_charging_tonight', 'on') %}
              {% set ev_start = today_at('22:00') - timedelta(days=1)
                   if now() < today_at('06:00') else today_at('22:00') %}
              {% set blocks = blocks + [{
                'start': ev_start.isoformat(),
                'end': (ev_start + timedelta(hours=8)).isoformat(),
                'energy_kwh': 40.0
              }] %}
            {% endif %}
            {# Away for the day: hold the whole daytime near zero #}
            {% if is_state('input_boolean.away_today', 'on') %}
              {% set blocks = blocks + [{
                'start': (today_at('08:00')).isoformat(),
                'end': (today_at('18:00')).isoformat(),
                'energy_kwh': 1.0,
                'mode': 'set'
              }] %}
            {% endif %}
            {{ blocks }}
```

Each entry is a time span plus the energy for that whole span:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `start`, `end` | ISO-8601 timestamps. **Must include a UTC offset** — `isoformat()` on a HA template time gives you one. |
| `energy_kwh` | Total kWh across the span, spread over the periods it covers. Not a per-period value. |
| `mode` | `add` (default) adds to your normal forecast; a **negative** value subtracts. `set` replaces it across the span. |

Use `add` for things that are happening on top of normal (the EV tonight), a negative `add` for a regular load that *isn't* happening (the EV is away, so subtract the usual evening session), and `set` for the blunt cases where you don't know what the baseline holds — away for a week, or forcing a window near zero.

Entries can be timestamped for tomorrow; BESS places them on the real horizon, so an entry that starts at 22:00 and runs to 06:00 is correctly split across midnight.

**One trap when writing overnight entries:** `today_at()` re-evaluates against the current day, so an entry anchored at `today_at('22:00')` jumps forward a full day the moment midnight passes — taking the still-running session out of the forecast just as the optimizer needs it. Anchor to the previous day while you are still inside the window, as the example above does.

**If the declaration is broken, BESS says so rather than ignoring it.** A missing, unavailable or malformed entity is reported as an error on the system health check — declaring an EV session and having it silently dropped would be worse than a clear failure. The one thing BESS corrects rather than rejects: if a subtraction removes more load than your forecast contains, that period is clamped to zero and a warning is raised, because negative consumption isn't physical.

### EV Charging and Discharge Inhibit

BESS does not control EV charging — it is designed to work alongside it. Under normal circumstances there is no conflict: when electricity is cheap, both the car and the battery charge at the same time.

The exception is grid reward programs such as **Tibber grid rewards**. These programs can start EV charging for grid balancing reasons, even when the spot price is not at its lowest. If BESS were to discharge the battery at the same time, that energy would flow toward the car instead of from the grid — you would miss the grid reward income and also lose the battery capacity you would otherwise have had available for the home.

To prevent this, BESS auto-detects any `binary_sensor` whose entity ID ends with `_charging` or `_is_charging` (for example `binary_sensor.zap263668_charging`), or contains `discharge_inhibit`, and treats it as a **discharge inhibit** signal. When the sensor is `on`, battery discharging is paused regardless of what the schedule says.

The discharge inhibit only affects discharging — it does not change the TOU schedule, trigger battery charging, or interfere with the EV charging session in any way.
